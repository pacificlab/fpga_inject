### AES_SC  

### top_level.v

**Location:** `/firmware/hdl/AES_SC/sources/top_level.v`  
Implements a UART-based AES encryption/decryption system using a Finite State Machine (FSM) for controlling data flow and process coordination.

**Key Features:**
- **UART Receiver (`async_receiver`):** Receives data and outputs 8-bit parallel bytes.
- **UART Transmitter (`async_transmitter`):** Serializes and sends 8-bit parallel bytes.
- **AES Core (`aes_core`):** Performs encryption or decryption based on configuration.

**Finite State Machine (FSM):**
- **States:**
  - `IDLE (0000)`: Waits for start byte.
  - `REC_BYTES (0001)`: Receives 16 bytes.
  - `AES_START (0010)`: Signals AES core to start.
  - `AES_DELAY (1000)`: Waits for AES to finish.
  - `AES_IDLE (0011)`: Monitors AES core.
  - `AES_FINISH (0100)`: Reads AES output.
  - `SEND_BYTE (0101)`: Prepares a byte for transmission.
  - `BYTE_SENDING (0110)`: Sends a byte and shifts data.
  - `BYTE_WAIT (0111)`: Waits for transmitter to idle.
  - `SEND_DELAY (1001)`: Delays between transmissions.

**Workflow:**
1. **Reception:** FSM enters `REC_BYTES` state to store 16 bytes in `data_i`.
2. **Processing:** FSM transitions to `AES_START`, signals AES core, and monitors processing in `AES_IDLE`.
3. **Transmission:** FSM retrieves `data_o` and transmits bytes in `SEND_BYTE`.

**Control Signals:**
- `load_i`: Starts AES core.
- `TxD_start`: Initiates UART transmission.
- `rec_byte_count` & `send_byte_count`: Track received/sent bytes.

**Encryption/Decryption Modes:**
- `dec_i = 0`: Encryption.
- `dec_i = 1`: Decryption.

**FPGA Short-Circuit Generation Script Using RapidWright**

This document provides a detailed description of a script designed to programmatically generate configurable short circuits (SCs) within FPGA designs using the RapidWright framework. The script processes Vivado DCP (Design CheckPoint) files and uses tools from BYU Shorty library to define and create shortened regions in the FPGA.

**Features**

Processes Vivado-generated DCP files.
Supports user-defined FPGA device configurations.
Allows selection of specific enabling nets.
Configurable short-circuit regions with various sizes and quantities (e.g., 1000, 2000, ..., 15000 SCs).
Outputs modified DCP files for further analysis.

**Requirements**

Java Development Kit (JDK).
RapidWright framework installed and configured.
BYU Shorty library added as a dependency.
A pre-existing Vivado DCP file for the FPGA design.

**Description of Functions**

1. Initialization

String dcpPath = "<path_to_dcp>"; - Reads a Vivado-generated DCP file (dcpPath).
String deviceName = "<fpga_device_name>"; - Initializes the FPGA device (deviceName).
Design design = Design.readCheckpoint(dcpPath); - Creates a Design object for further manipulation.

2. Net Selection 

Net n = design.getNet("enable_sc"); - Enables target net (enable_sc) to manage a short circuit array within the design.


3. Short Circuit Generation

ShortTools.createShortedRegion(design, start_x, end_x, start_y, end_y, n);
start_x, end_x: Horizontal boundaries of the region.
start_y, end_y: Vertical boundaries of the region.
n: Enabled net


4. Writing the Modified Design

design.writeCheckpoint("<output_path>"); - Saves the updated FPGA design with the short circuits included into a new DCP file.

**Usage Workflow**

1. Define the Input Design: Specify the path to the original DCP file and the FPGA device name.
2. Select the Target Enabling Net: (e.g., enable_sc).
3. Configure Short-Circuit Regions: Call the createShortedRegion function with appropriate parameters for the region size and location.
4. Generate Output Design: Save the modified design into a new DCP file for analysis.
