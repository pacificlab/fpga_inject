###  Comparative study: short-circuits vs. external glitches (protected)

In the given milestone, the following points should be completed:

- **a.** WITH glitch detectors, attempt fault injection using both internal (short-circuit) and external voltage glitches
- **b.** Using test methodology from 1., assess effectiveness of glitch detectors vs. glitches
- **c.** Status update on GitHub project page, documenting the results of the study

### What Was Done:

- **a.** && **b.**  Fault injections were attempted for each detector, using both internal (short-circuit) and external voltage glitches. Utilizing the test methodology from section 1, the effectiveness of the glitch detectors against the glitches was assessed:

 1.   `fpga_inject/firmware/hdl/Voltage_Glitch_Detectors/Detector_1/README.md`
 2.   `fpga_inject/firmware/hdl/Voltage_Glitch_Detectors/Detector_2/README.md`
 3.   `fpga_inject/firmware/hdl/Voltage_Glitch_Detectors/Detector_3/README.md`



- **c.** Code, documentation, and related items were re-released on GitHub.
